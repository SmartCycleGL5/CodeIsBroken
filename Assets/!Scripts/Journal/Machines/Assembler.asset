    text: 'The assembler holds materials put into it until it is able to craft.

      If
      the assembler is unable to craft, the assembler will halt until it is able
      to craft, and materials put into the assembler are not removed until the code
      is stopped.

      If the assembler has no valid crafting recipe it will stop
      working, it is therefore recommended to make sure the assembler has the correct
      materials put into it to avoid any blockages.

      Use the method Craft()
      to craft something if it has a valid combination. For example you can use iron
      and wood to create a chair. To learn more recipes check Recipes under Concepts.'
