  explanation: 'The most used building block, available from the beginning. The conveyor
    belt  is used for moving objects around the factory. It moves the items from 
    its output source to the machines and then to the selling area. The conveyor
    belt is controlled through a motor that the user can program. The conveyor belt
    can only be connected to two other conveyors at one time, meaning that the user
    can not create T-junctions where another conveyor is inputting items at the line,
    therefore they would have to use the robotic arm '
