Ths folder contains Roslyn C# user and template settings assets

To quickly edit user settings, you can use the menu: Tools -> Roslyn C# 2.0 -> Settings to view and edit the user settings in the inspector window.

- 	User settings (named RoslynCSharpUserSettings) 
		This asset will be generated automatically the first time the package is installed.
		It contains all settings that the user is able to modify and change the behaviour of the asset. 
		The Roslyn C# API's will use these settings in many cases unless you manually provide settings as an optional parameter (Override via code).
		It should NOT be renamed, or moved, but CAN be deleted if you want to reset to defaults, and it will be regenerated the next time Unity reloads scripts.
	
-	Template settings (named Editor/RoslynCSharpDefaultSettings)
		This asset is included with the asset and contains the default settings required to run all demos and most otehr code you might need.
		It should NOT be modified directly because all modifications will be lost when updating the asset
		It should NOT be renamed, moved or deleted as it will mean demos cannot run correctly if the user generated settings then also get deleted.
